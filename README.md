# TEE1010-Drummer
Using the FCB1010 as a Drum Machine.

See here for a demo: https://youtu.be/QBRSK-BldSU

I play guitar with some friends, none of who are drummers. We also have to play quietly to keep the neighbours happy. So I have made a drum machine using the FCB1010 and by replacing the internal Microcontroller with a Teensy and audio board. It's great for practicing the multitude of tracks we play.

Features: 
Different Styles of Beat and BPM.
Optional Song Count in.
Expression Pedal for changing complexity of beat
Expression Pedal for adding humanity (Probability of certain extra beats)
